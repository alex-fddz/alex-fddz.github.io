    title: "UWB and BLE communications performance monitoring"
    desc:
      During my master studies internship at <b>STMicroelectronics</b>, I
      proposed, developed and integrated a metrics system that allowed the
      team's developers to monitor the performance of their solution, involving
      the processing, transmission, and reception of Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) and
      Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) messages.
      </p><p>
      The development of the project involved the study and understanding of
      the complete code base in <code>C</code> for <code>STM32</code> platforms,
      for which I provided a flow diagram visualization (greatly appreciated by
      the team). I worked directly with the solution stack to identify and save
      relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPI). The data was saved into a local
      <code>InfluxDB</code> database during the automated integration tests
      using separate library written in <code>Python</code>.
      </p><p>
      Finally, I designed and integrated a comprehensive dashboard using
      <code>Grafana</code>, and set up automatic email alerts to notify the team
      members about performance degradations past a given threshold. As a
      result, the solution provided valuable insights for logic improvement
      opportunities, as well as confidence for the team to develop with ease,
      knowing performance issues would be surfaced automatically.

  pycoreconf:
    title: "CORECONF implementation: an OSCORE/EDHOC use case"
    desc:
      As part of my master's studies in IoT at <b>IMT Atlantique</b>, I
      collaborated on a research project with a team from <b>Universidad de
      Murcia</b>, which explored the application of Software Defined Networking
      (SDN) paradigms in resource-constrained environments. The team identified
      CORECONF (CoAP Management Interface) as a potential solution to establish
      a security context among network devices, but lacked the expertise and
      tools to test it.
      </p><p>
      The project involved researching the protocol and understanding all
      relevant technologies, prototyping solutions, and integrating the final
      solution, which we published as <a class="font-mono" 
      href="https://github.com/alex-fddz/pycoreconf">pycoreconf</a>, into a
      containerized environment as a Proof of Concept. The project demanded good
      multicultural communication skills and culminated in a conference paper
      accepted for publication at <b>IEEE NOMS 2025</b> in Honolulu, USA.
      </p><p>
      <i>Abstract — The Internet of Things (IoT) aims to gather valuable data
      from our surroundings through resource-constrained networks and devices.
      For this reason, efficient and lightweight communication protocols are
      required to be developed and adopted. CORECONF, a network management
      protocol designed for constrained environments, provides a promising
      solution for IoT device configuration. This work introduces pycoreconf, an
      open-source implementation of CORECONF, with the goal of testing the
      protocol and making it more accessible to researchers and developers by
      enabling its use in real-world scenarios and experimental setups. In this
      paper, we evaluate its performance and applicability as a southbound
      interface in an SDN-based architecture, demonstrating its potential for
      configuring security contexts between IoT devices. Potential for other use
      cases remains to be explored in future work. Our results suggest that
      pycoreconf is a viable tool for those interested in exploring and adopting
      CORECONF in IoT scenarios.</i>

  oee:
    title: "OEE Metrics solution for Industry 4.0"
    desc:
      In collaboration with my team, we developed a complete metrics solution
      using <code>Ignition 8</code> to measure Overall Equipment Effectiveness
      (OEE) in a manufacturing environment, boosting digital transformation
      efforts. Our project involved close cooperation with various departments,
      including the client's IT, planning, ERP/SAP, operators, and management,
      to design a custom solution that met their specific needs.
      </p><p>
      By gathering data directly from the machines' PLCs through <code>OPC
      UA</code> and <code>Modbus</code> protocols, we ensured accurate and
      real-time monitoring of production data. An intuitive tablet interface
      allowed factory workers to provide details on downtime and other events
      directly at the machines. This user-centered approach engaged operators
      and eased data acquisiton on the plant's floor. Separate desktop apps and
      per-area dashboards allowed other departments to set production targets
      and follow the plant's live performance.
      </p><p>
      I eventually took over the lead and development of the project,
      communicating directly with the client and addressing improvement
      opportunities and implementation issues. Interface redesigns allowed for
      faster workflows and clearer visuals, while backend processes and
      <code>SQL</code> queries optimizations boosted the solution's performance
      by roughly 80%. I also provided training for operators and managers,
      ensuring they understood how to use and leverage the new system. The final
      solution included features such as real-time machine status and production
      monitoring, work order scheduling, automated alarms, notifications, and
      PDF reports, providing valuable insights at all levels.
