      title: "UWB and BLE communications performance monitoring"
      keywords: UI/UX,STM32,InfluxDB,Grafana,C
      filters: embedded
      desc:
        During my master studies internship at <b>STMicroelectronics</b>, I
        proposed, developed and integrated a metrics system that allowed the
        team's developers to monitor the performance of their solution, involving
        the processing, transmission, and reception of Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) and
        Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) messages.
        </p><p>
        The development of the project involved the study and understanding of
        the complete code base in <code>C</code> for <code>STM32</code> platforms,
        for which I provided a flow diagram visualization (greatly appreciated by
        the team). I worked directly with the solution stack to identify and save
        relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPI). The data was saved into a local
        <code>InfluxDB</code> database during the automated integration tests
        using separate library written in <code>Python</code>.
        </p><p>
        Finally, I designed and integrated a comprehensive dashboard using
        <code>Grafana</code>, and set up automatic email alerts to notify the team
        members about performance degradations past a given threshold. As a
        result, the solution provided valuable insights for logic improvement
        opportunities, as well as confidence for the team to develop with ease,
        knowing performance issues would be surfaced automatically.

      title: "CORECONF implementation: an OSCORE/EDHOC use case"
      keywords: IoT,Publication,Docker,Python
      filters: iot
      desc:
        As part of my master's studies in IoT at <b>IMT Atlantique</b>, I
        collaborated on a research project with a team from <b>Universidad de
        Murcia</b>, which explored the application of Software Defined Networking
        (SDN) paradigms in resource-constrained environments. The team identified
        CORECONF (CoAP Management Interface) as a potential solution to establish
        a security context among network devices, but lacked the expertise and
        tools to test it.
        </p><p>
        The project involved researching the protocol and understanding all
        relevant technologies, prototyping solutions, and integrating the final
        solution, which we published as <a class="font-mono" 
        href="https://github.com/alex-fddz/pycoreconf">pycoreconf</a>, into a
        containerized environment as a Proof of Concept. The project demanded good
        multicultural communication skills and culminated in a conference paper
        accepted for publication at <b>IEEE NOMS 2025</b> in Honolulu, USA.
        </p><p>
        <i>Abstract — The Internet of Things (IoT) aims to gather valuable data
        from our surroundings through resource-constrained networks and devices.
        For this reason, efficient and lightweight communication protocols are
        required to be developed and adopted. CORECONF, a network management
        protocol designed for constrained environments, provides a promising
        solution for IoT device configuration. This work introduces pycoreconf, an
        open-source implementation of CORECONF, with the goal of testing the
        protocol and making it more accessible to researchers and developers by
        enabling its use in real-world scenarios and experimental setups. In this
        paper, we evaluate its performance and applicability as a southbound
        interface in an SDN-based architecture, demonstrating its potential for
        configuring security contexts between IoT devices. Potential for other use
        cases remains to be explored in future work. Our results suggest that
        pycoreconf is a viable tool for those interested in exploring and adopting
        CORECONF in IoT scenarios.</i>

      title: "OEE Metrics solution for Industry 4.0"
      keywords: UI/UX,Ignition 8,Python
      filters: automation
      desc:
        In collaboration with my team, we developed a complete metrics solution
        using <code>Ignition 8</code> to measure Overall Equipment Effectiveness
        (OEE) in a manufacturing environment, boosting digital transformation
        efforts. Our project involved close cooperation with various departments,
        including the client's IT, planning, ERP/SAP, operators, and management,
        to design a custom solution that met their specific needs.
        </p><p>
        By gathering data directly from the machines' PLCs through <code>OPC
        UA</code> and <code>Modbus</code> protocols, we ensured accurate and
        real-time monitoring of production data. An intuitive tablet interface
        allowed factory workers to provide details on downtime and other events
        directly at the machines. This user-centered approach engaged operators
        and eased data acquisiton on the plant's floor. Separate desktop apps and
        per-area dashboards allowed other departments to set production targets
        and follow the plant's live performance.
        </p><p>
        I eventually took over the lead and development of the project,
        communicating directly with the client and addressing improvement
        opportunities and implementation issues. Interface redesigns allowed for
        faster workflows and clearer visuals, while backend processes and
        <code>SQL</code> queries optimizations boosted the solution's performance
        by roughly 80%. I also provided training for operators and managers,
        ensuring they understood how to use and leverage the new system. The final
        solution included features such as real-time machine status and production
        monitoring, work order scheduling, automated alarms, notifications, and
        PDF reports, providing valuable insights at all levels.

      keywords: 3D Print,Solidworks,BLE,ESP32,nRF,C
      filters: embedded
      desc:
        Cycling in an urban environment may be dangerous, especially if the
        commuter is unfamiliar with the city, there is no dedicated bicycle
        infrastructure, and needs directions to get from point A to point B.
        Mainstream navigation assistance solutions involve the use of hearing or
        sight to locate oneself, which may distract the cyclists and reduce
        awareness of their surroundings. The <b>"Bike Assistant for Navigation
        and Guidance (BANG)"</b> project aims to solve this issue by using
        haptics to guide cyclists.
        </p><p>
        I joined the Romania-based startup in the early stages of the program,
        participating in incubator events and pitches. I then focused on
        developing the hardware part of the solution. I specifically worked on
        the embedded development, product design and mechanical simulations
        using <code>Solidworks</code>, and <code>3D printing</code> for
        prototyping. After working on the proof of concept with an
        <code>ESP32</code>, we later switched to a <code>nRF52840 Dongle</code>
        with <code>Zephyr RTOS</code> and custom made PCBs for a streamlined
        product that integrated seamlessly with any bike handlebar.
        </p><p>
        The companion app then sent turn-by-turn navigation instructions to the
        embedded device using an efficient in-house protocol, through Bluetooth
        Low Energy (<code>BLE</code>). The final working prototype was ready for
        the fund-raiser campaign launch.

      filters: automation
      desc:
        An important client in the food industry required an automated system to
        monitor bread size as it exits the oven, as variations in their recipe
        could result in sub-optimal quality criteria.
        </p><p>
        The solution I developed involved the integration of industrial-grade
        distance sensors controlled through a <code>Siemens PLC</code>
        (programmed using <code>TIA Portal</code>), and a <code>HMI</code>
        (Human Machine Interface) built with <code>Ignition 8</code> to monitor,
        callibrate and control the system, and which notified the users in case
        the measurements were ever out of spec. I then worked in tandem with
        automation and maintenance technicians to deploy the solution in the
        production chain.
        </p><p>
        The solution system was able to monitor the bread quality criteria in
        real time, which greatly improved response times for addressing the
        issue, and thus a higher consistency in the quality of the product. Our
        client greatly appreciated features such as bread sizing trend graphs,
        and the ability to export the data for further analysis and statistics.

      filters: automation
      desc:
        As part of my 2018 internship for concluding my international exchange
        program at INSA Rennes, I developed a control system for a 2-axis, 4-bar
        robotic platform. The hardware was already in place, and my task was to
        make it work. I started by studying the platform's components,
        connections, and overall structure, and then modeled its geometry to
        derive both direct and inverse kinematics, computing the end effector's
        position from motor angles and vice versa. Using trigonometric analysis
        and identifying singularities, I defined accurate geometric models of
        the system.
        <p></p>
        I implemented the control logic in <code>MATLAB</code> and
        <code>Simulink</code> and built the graphical interface using
        <code>dSPACE ControlDesk</code>. After properly acquiring the motor
        encoder data, I programmed smooth position, velocity, and acceleration
        curves using 5th-degree polynomial formulas. A <code>PI</code> control
        loop ensured the motors followed these trajectories accurately. The GUI
        supported both direct and inverse control modes, allowing the user to
        input either motor angles or effector coordinates. Additional features
        included adjustable motor speed and acceleration limits, input
        validation, a "GO" command, and live plots comparing real versus target
        outputs.
        <p></p>
        This project gave me not only hands-on experience in control systems and
        industrial robotics, but also the insight of looking at mechatronic
        systems as puzzles where math, code and metal have to agree before
        anything moves. Seeing the system finally move made me realize that
        complex theory is not just background or a burden during deployment, but
        both the blueprint of the system's logic and the key to understanding
        how and why it works.
